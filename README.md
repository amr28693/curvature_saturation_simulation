# Curvature-Induced Saturation Simulation

This repository contains a simple Python simulation that demonstrates curvature-induced saturation in growing reaction networks, based on the theory proposed in:

[arXiv:2504.14700](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14700)

## What it does

- Builds a reaction network as a weighted graph
- Estimates local curvature at each node
- Tracks how curvature changes as the network grows
- Visualizes the saturation phase where curvature plateaus

## How to run

1. Open `curvature_saturation_simulation.ipynb` in JupyterLab
2. Run all cells
3. View the curvature vs. network growth plot
